## Introduction

​This is our submission for the second Front-end assignment in JavaScript, focusing on React and
The assignment was handed out by Piotr Dziubinski.

## Wireframe

Before we wrote any code, we created a wireframe to visualize our website. To do this we used Figma:

![Wireframe1.png](./Wireframe1.png)
![Wireframe2.png](./Wireframe2.png)

## React and Heroku setup

After we had completed the wireframe and had a good idea of how we wanted the app to work, we created the React project by using Reacts CRA. Before starting to develop the components themselves, we made sure to deploy our upcoming project to Heroku, giving us access to the API key and a place to write and save data for our database.

## Adding the React components

We assigned different pages to each member; Marius was in charge of the login page, Ulrik was in charge of the translation page and Linnea took care of the profile page. Each project member made views, associated components and neccessary code to make the website have its desired functionality:

The Profile page utilizes ​a ProfileHeader, ProfileActions, ProfileTranslateHistory and ProfileTranslateHistory components to achieve it's desired goals. The header simply provides custom text as to what the specific user will see when they log in, whereas the actions take care of the clear history button.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
